🧠 Daily Progress Report — Credify Automation (Oct 30, 2025)
🔹 Objective

To fully automate the process of fetching YouTube performance metrics and storing them in Supabase via AWS Lambda, running daily without manual input.
This task ensures that Credify’s backend maintains an up-to-date database of video analytics for creators’ profiles.

🔹 What We Achieved Today

Database Schema Refactor in Supabase

Replaced old tables metrics and latest_metrics with new, platform-specific ones:

youtube_metrics → main metrics table

youtube_latest_metrics → view for latest entries

Ensured backward compatibility with related tables:
users, projects, user_projects, user_metrics, and roles.

Updated the foreign key constraints to link metrics correctly via p_id (YouTube video ID).

Cleaned obsolete tables and rebuilt triggers and functions for metric aggregation.

Data Migration

Successfully migrated existing metrics data into the new youtube_metrics table using SQL scripts.

Verified that old records transferred correctly and Supabase schema integrity was preserved.

AWS Lambda Automation

Deployed the Lambda function get_youtube_metrics.

Configured environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, YOUTUBE_API_KEY).

Confirmed successful API connectivity between:

YouTube Data API → Lambda

Lambda → Supabase REST API

Verified data insertion with response 201 (success).

Event Scheduling

Created an EventBridge rule (daily_youtube_metrics) to trigger Lambda daily at 07:45 UTC (08:45 Berlin time).

Tested multiple manual invocations, confirming automated metric uploads.

Supabase Validation

Confirmed youtube_metrics is being updated with current data, correct timestamps, and consistent schema.

Validated that the newest fetched_at matches the Lambda run time (UTC format confirmed working).

🔹 Key Result

✅ End-to-end automation is now functional.
YouTube data is fetched daily, stored in Supabase, and linked via p_id for each project.
This establishes the foundation for Credify’s creator analytics backend.

🔹 What’s Left for Tomorrow

Time Zone Enhancement

Adjust Lambda timestamps to reflect Berlin local time (CET/CEST) dynamically.

Frontend Integration

Connect the youtube_metrics table to the Streamlit dashboard for visualization:

Daily growth

Engagement trends

Top videos per creator

User Linking Logic

Extend automation to update user_projects and user_metrics automatically after each metrics insert.

Code Cleanup & Versioning

Push final Lambda code and Supabase schema SQL into GitHub for version tracking.

🔹 Next Step Recommendations

✅ Build Streamlit analytics dashboard (visual insights per video).

⚙️ Extend Lambda to handle multiple video IDs dynamically (from Supabase “projects” table).

🌐 Later: expand system for Instagram, TikTok, and Vimeo, using same data model (multi-platform metrics).

📧 Optional: enable email/Slack reporting for daily metric summaries.

🔹 Summary

Today’s session established Credify’s first fully autonomous data pipeline:

YouTube → AWS Lambda → Supabase → (soon) Streamlit

The architecture is scalable, maintainable, and ready for multi-platform expansion.
