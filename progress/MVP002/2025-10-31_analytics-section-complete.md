# Analytics Section Implementation Report — Credify
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Focus:** Analytics page with Spotify-for-Artists-style visualization

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a comprehensive analytics dashboard for Credify that allows creators to view their daily performance metrics across all credited videos. The implementation follows Spotify for Artists' design patterns for familiarity and clarity, focusing on a single-metric spotlight view with clean, readable visualizations.

---

## ✅ What We Achieved

### 1. **Data Pipeline & Normalization**

**Daily Metrics Aggregation**
- Created `fetch_user_daily_timeseries()` function that:
  - Fetches all projects linked to a user via `user_projects`
  - Pulls `youtube_metrics` snapshots within a date range
  - Normalizes data to daily increments (handles both cumulative and daily-stored data)
  - Aggregates across all user's videos per day
  - Returns a clean DataFrame with `date`, `views`, `likes`, `comments` columns

**Smart Data Detection**
- Automatically detects whether stored metrics are cumulative or already daily increments
- Uses day-over-day diffing for cumulative snapshots
- Handles edge cases (missing days, counter resets, multiple snapshots per day)

**Caching**
- Implemented `@st.cache_data` decorators for performance
- Reduces Supabase queries on repeated page loads
- Cache invalidates naturally with Streamlit's cache management

**Files Modified:**
- `credify_app.py` (lines 236-314)

---

### 2. **Spotify-Style Metric Cards**

**Visual Design**
- Row of compact metric cards (Views, Likes, Comments)
- Each card displays:
  - Metric name (14px, semi-bold)
  - Total value for selected date range (20px, bold, formatted with commas)
- Selected card highlighted with darker background (#E0E0E0) and black border
- Unselected cards use light grey (#F5F5F5)
- Smooth hover effects (#EBEBEB) for unselected cards

**Interaction**
- Clickable cards via invisible button overlays
- Selection persists in `st.session_state`
- Chart updates immediately when metric changes

**Accessibility**
- High contrast text (#000000 on light backgrounds)
- Clear visual hierarchy (selected vs unselected states)
- Readable at all sizes

**Files Modified:**
- `credify_app.py` (lines 628-751)

---

### 3. **Spotify-Style Area Chart**

**Plotly Integration**
- Replaced Streamlit's basic `st.line_chart()` with Plotly
- Full control over styling and interactions

**Visual Features**
- **Area fill**: Translucent blue (`rgba(66,133,244,0.2)`) fills to zero baseline
- **Line on top**: Solid blue line (2.5px width) remains visible
- **Smooth interpolation**: 3-day rolling average for Spotify-like curves
- **Gridlines**: Subtle light grey grid for readability
- **Transparent background**: Matches app theme
- **Tooltips**: Formatted date, metric name, and formatted values

**Layout**
- Height: 320px
- Full-width responsive
- Clean margins (no padding)
- No modebar (toolbar hidden)

**Files Modified:**
- `credify_app.py` (lines 760-811)
- `requirements.txt` (added `plotly>=5.0.0`)

---

### 4. **Date Range Controls**

**Presets**
- Last 7 days
- Last 28 days (default)
- Last 12 months
- Custom date range picker

**Fallback Logic**
- If no data found for today, automatically tries ending yesterday
- Prevents empty states when AWS job hasn't run yet today

**Files Modified:**
- `credify_app.py` (lines 584-621)

---

### 5. **Performance Insights**

**Previous Period Comparison**
- Calculates delta vs previous N days (where N = selected range length)
- Shows absolute change and percentage change
- Color-coded: green for positive, red for negative
- Handles edge cases (division by zero, empty previous periods)

**Peak Day Detection**
- Identifies the day with highest activity for selected metric
- Displays date and value

**Files Modified:**
- `credify_app.py` (lines 813-832)

---

### 6. **Data Seeding for Demo**

**Standalone Seeding Script**
- Created `scripts/seed_demo_data.py` for generating demo analytics data
- Generates realistic daily increments with:
  - Weekend effects (70% of normal views)
  - Gradual growth trends (~1% per month)
  - Random daily variation (-30% to +50%)
  - Viral spikes (5% chance, 3-8x multiplier)
  - Occasional dips (10% chance, 40-80% multiplier)
- Links demo videos to specified user via `user_projects`
- Safe re-runs (skips if recent data exists, unless `--force`)

**Note:** Eventually replaced with CSV import workflow for production demo data.

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/seed_demo_data.py`

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Single Metric View?

**User Experience**
- Reduces cognitive load (one metric at a time)
- Matches Spotify for Artists' proven UX pattern
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Performance**
- Faster chart rendering (single series vs multiple)
- Cleaner tooltips
- Less visual clutter

### Why Area Chart?

**Visual Clarity**
- Fill provides sense of volume/activity
- Line shows precise trend
- More engaging than plain line chart

**Spotify Alignment**
- Matches industry standard for time-series metrics
- Professional appearance

### Why Light Color Palette?

**Readability First**
- Dark cards (original design) caused contrast issues
- Light grey cards (#F5F5F5 / #E0E0E0) with black text ensure WCAG compliance
- Selected card still visually distinct

---

## ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Data Normalization Approach**
   - Handling both cumulative and daily-stored data automatically
   - Robust edge case handling (missing days, resets)
   - Clean separation of data fetching and presentation

2. **Plotly Integration**
   - Much more flexibility than Streamlit's native charts
   - Smooth rendering and interactions
   - Easy to style to match design system

3. **Session State Management**
   - Simple, reliable metric selection persistence
   - No external dependencies

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Significantly improved performance
   - Reduced Supabase load

5. **Iterative Design Process**
   - Started with basic line chart
   - Refined to area chart with smooth curves
   - Adjusted colors for readability

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Button Overlay Click Handling**

**Challenge:** Making HTML cards clickable while using Streamlit's state management.

**Solution:**
- Invisible buttons positioned absolutely over cards
- JavaScript event listeners for hover effects
- Streamlit handles state updates on button clicks

**Trade-off:**
- Slightly more complex DOM structure
- Works reliably across browsers

---

### 2. **Data Shape Detection**

**Challenge:** `youtube_metrics` might contain cumulative snapshots or daily increments, depending on ingestion method.

**Solution:**
- Heuristic detection: if values are mostly non-decreasing, treat as cumulative
- Apply day-over-day diffing for cumulative data
- Use values directly if already daily

**Future Improvement:**
- Could add a `data_type` flag in database schema
- Or standardize ingestion to always store daily increments

---

### 3. **Smooth Curve Interpolation**

**Challenge:** Plotly doesn't have built-in spline/monotone interpolation like D3.

**Solution:**
- Applied 3-day rolling average before plotting
- Achieves smooth curves without losing detail
- Center-aligned window for better smoothing

**Alternative Considered:**
- Scipy interpolation (rejected for simplicity)
- Spline libraries (rejected for dependency overhead)

---

### 4. **Color Contrast Issues**

**Challenge:** Original dark selected card (#2E2E2E) made white text hard to read.

**Solution:**
- Switched to lighter palette (#F5F5F5 / #E0E0E0)
- All text uses black (#000000) for maximum contrast
- Selected card still visually distinct via darker grey and thicker border

---

### 5. **Empty State Handling**

**Challenge:** Users might select date ranges with no data yet.

**Solution:**
- Fallback logic tries yesterday if today has no data
- Clear messaging when no metrics exist
- Warning when data is too sparse for meaningful trends

---

## 📊 Technical Stack

**Frontend:**
- Streamlit for UI framework
- Plotly for advanced charting
- Custom CSS/JavaScript for card interactions

**Backend:**
- Supabase for data storage
