description: Mandatory Streamlit MCP usage for Credify
globs: *.py

# Streamlit MCP Rule

- Always use the Streamlit MCP integration for any Streamlit-related code, tooling, or queries. No exceptions.
- When rendering UI, managing session, or handling auth via Streamlit, prefer MCP-provided helpers and calls where available.
- If MCP is unavailable or misconfigured, block the operation and surface a clear error guiding how to fix MCP configuration.

## Enforcement guidance

- Before calling `streamlit` APIs directly, check that the Streamlit MCP is available and route through its wrappers.
- For tasks involving Streamlit, use workspace MCP wrappers and helpers instead of direct `st.*` calls where wrappers exist.
